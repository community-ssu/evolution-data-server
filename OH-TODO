Opened Hand To Do List

Finish Address Book port [N]
- remove the status argument from e_data_book_open (1 hour)
- lock race when starting bookview with status messages


Port libedataserverui to use DBus libraries [N] (1 week)
- should be trivial, but you never know


Add --with-backends=... (1 week)
- configure flags to turn on/off selected backends
- probably easier to do --without-webcal, --without-groupwise etc


Solve the libebook vs libebook-dbus naming problem [N]
- this means that every program that links to a ported library has to be
  modified to use the new path
- if DBus will go upstream, maybe libebook etc could be named libebook-corba?


Merge any patches from HEAD Bonobo libraries back into our copies (1 day)
- specifically the portability/gthread fixes by Tor


Investigate the threadsafe GObject patches, to see if the object library in Camel can be removed (1 week)
- currently libebook uses camel for parsing email addresses
- maybe statically linking to camel would be a good compromise, suffer the extra
  object layer and see if the linker will throw away the symbols we are not
  using
